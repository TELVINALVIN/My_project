            <h1>THE LION</h1>
            <p id="p1" class="odd">Lion<em>(Panthera leo)</em>,large,powerful built cat(family Felidae) that is second in size to tiger;it is a famous apex predator.The proverbial"king of beasts",the lion ha sbeen one of the best known wild animals since earliest times.Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grasslands,<u>savannah and dense scrub,and open woodland</u>.Historically they ranged across;</p>

                <li>Europe</li>
                <li>Asia</li>
                <li>Africa</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>General Characteristics</h2>
            <p id="p2" class="even">The lion is a well muscled with a long body,large head and short legs.Size and appearance vary considerably between sexes.The male's outstanding characteristics is his mane,which varies between different individuals and populations.In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark,almost black giving the cat a <u>majestic</u> apperance</p>
            <h3>Prides</h3>
            <p id="p3" class="odd">Lion are unique among cats in that they live in a group or pride.The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups that may unite to hunt to hunt or share a meal.A pride consists of sevearl generations of lioness some of which are related,a smaller number of breeding males and their cubs.</p>
            <p id="p4" class="even">There are a number of completing evolutionary explanations for why lion form groups.Large body size and high<u>density</u>of their main prey probably make group life more efficient for females,in terms of energy expenditure.Group of females ,for example, hunt more effectively and better to defend cubs against infanticidal males and there hunting territory aganst other females.The relative importance of these factors is debated, and it is not clear which was responsible for the establishment of the group life and which are secondary benefits.</p>
            <h3>Hunting</h3>
            <p id="p5" class="odd">Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents and baboons to Cape buffalo and hypopotamus but they predominantly hunt medium to large sized hoofed animals such as zebras.Prey preferences vary geographically between neighbouring prides.Lions are knownto take elephants and giraffes but if only the individual is young or especially sick.</p>
